# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

I was working on the Churn Dataset and thought to give dashboard a website look with the section divided into the main details of the customers, churn analysis, customers info.
My first approach was to check the data & perform cleaning for better results & started my analysis on Power BI Desktop.
